# Insurance Calc 

## Pre-requisites

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required fields. 

## Docker

You can start the project with docker using this command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

If you want to develop in docker with autoreload and exposed ports add `-f docker-compose.dev.yml` to your docker command.

## Project structure

```bash
$ tree "insurance_calc"
insurance_calc
├── db  # module contains db configurations
│   └── models  # Package contains different models for ORMs.
├── __main__.py  # Startup script. Starts uvicorn.
├── services  # Package for different external services such as rabbit or redis etc.
├── settings.py  # Main configuration settings for project.
├── static  # Static content.
├── tests  # Tests for project.
└── web  # Package contains web server. Handlers, startup config.
    ├── api  # Package with all handlers.
    │   └── router.py  # Main router.
    ├── application.py  # FastAPI application configuration.
    └── lifespan.py  # Contains actions to perform on startup and shutdown.
```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here. 

All environment variables should start with "INSURANCE_CALC_" prefix.

For example if you see in your "insurance_calc/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "INSURANCE_CALC_RANDOM_PARAMETER" 
variable to configure the value. This behaviour can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `insurance_calc.settings.Settings.Config`.

You can read more about BaseSettings class here: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit is very useful to check your code before publishing it.
It's configured using .pre-commit-config.yaml file.

By default it runs:
* ruff (spots possible bugs);

### Reverting migrations

If you want to revert migrations, you should run:
```bash
# revert all migrations up to: revision_id.
alembic downgrade <revision_id>

# Revert everything.
